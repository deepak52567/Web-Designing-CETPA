          <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
          <p>Our look is the result comments, our own experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels.
             Distinctive covers complement our distinctive approach to techincal topics, breathing personality 
             and life into potentially dry subjects. The animal on the cover of Programming PHP is cuckoo 
             (Cuculus canorus). Cuckoo epitomize minimal effort. The common cuckoo doesn't buid a nest - instead,
             the female chuckoo finds another bird's nest that already contains eggs and lays an egg in it (a 
             process she may repeat up to 25 times, leaving 1 egg per nest). The nest mother rarely notices the 
            addition, and usually incubates the egg and then feeds the hatching as if it were her own. Why don't 
            eggs look the same in the ultraviolet spectrum, which birds can see. </p>
